    <h1>Andile Mlata, Developer.</h1>
    I am currently working as a frontend developer at Discovery, mostly working
    with Java, Spring SpringBoot and AngularJS building member facing health
    applications. I studied Computer Science at UKZN and like most devs I became
    interested in computers after I realised the liberating potential of
    computers, it became obvious to me that in the future computers would become
    an integral extension of human life, all mobile devices are basically
    “phantom limbs,” i.e an extension of the human body. I’m interested in
    continuously learning and developing new ways of thinking, optimising,
    reducing complexity and automating mundane tasks. Besides computers Im
    interested in <a href="photography.html">photography</a> and music art,
    <a href="literature">literature</a> and indie films. (sometimes I also
    <a href="drawings">draw.</a>)

    <h2>What I want to do next</h2>
    I would like to work with and explore new frontend technologies specifically
    React , React Native, GraphQl and Neo4J. I would like to work in a team that
    is not afraid to try new technologies.
